# Afiyyah Connect

Afiyyah Connect is an integrated information system between the student affairs and the clinic at Ibnu Abbas Klaten to streamline data collection, storage, and real-time access to historical data, replacing the manual process.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK
- Supabase CLI

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
3. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill values:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (public anon key only; do not use service-role keys)
4. Run the app: `flutter run`

## Features

- **Monitoring:** Users can monitor the health of students.
- **Medical History:** Users can view the medical history of students.
- **Profile:** Users can view and edit their profile.

## Architecture Overview

- **High-level system architecture:** The project uses a feature-based architecture with Riverpod for state management and Supabase for the backend.
- **Folder structure:**
  - `lib/app`: Contains the core application logic, such as themes, models, and services.
  - `lib/features`: Contains the different features of the application, such as `auth`, `dashboard`, `profile`, etc.
- **Design patterns:** The project uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.
- **Data flow:** Data flows from the UI to the ViewModel, which then interacts with the services to fetch data from Supabase.

## Development Guide

- **Code style:** The project follows the default Flutter linting rules.
- **Naming conventions:** The project follows the standard Dart naming conventions.
- **Git workflow:** The project uses the standard Gitflow workflow.
- **Testing strategy:** The project uses widget testing to test the UI components.

## Self-hosting (Supabase)

- Create a Supabase project
- Import schema and enable RLS (see `supabase/` folder)
- Configure `.env` using `env.example`

## Security

- Never ship service-role keys in the client app; only use the public anon key
- Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled and policies are configured for all tables
- See `SECURITY.md` for reporting vulnerabilities and security guidance
